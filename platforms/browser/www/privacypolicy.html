You allow encryption and secure storage on SSC's cloud servers of: location, consent fact confirmation, verbal consents, genders, protection, moods, udid(s) and all yes and no's. Stored data shall be available only pursuant to a judicial or quasi-judicial process issued by a court or other judicial body and a file retrieval fee; even under these circumstances, users identities are not requested by SSC.<br />
                        <br />

                        Data that does not personally identify you, excluding individual verbal consents, may be calculated and tabulated for research purposes, including: geographic data, categories of users by gender, popularity of protection, how many yes or no consents or people that changed their minds, and the correlation between app usage and decreased incidents of sexual assaults, unplanned pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections.<br />
                        <br />
                        <br />

The rights granted herein are limited to SSC's and its licensors' intellectual property rights, including copyrights, in the SSC Software and do not include any other patents or intellectual property rights.

This SSC Software is available and intended for use in the United States of America and its territories and possessions; any use outside of the United States of America and its territories is not covered by this license and the warranties hereunder are not applicable.
                    <br />
                        <br />
                        2. License.

                        <br />
                        3. Use. The SSC Software is not intended to provide legal advice or be a substitute for any permissions necessary to engage in intimate acts with another.
